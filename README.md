# What is this project?

This is a Chat Bot app. The front end is PyQt6, back end is openai's text-davinci-003 model. Since using this API actually costs money, using the free ChatGPT is more preferable. Plus, ChatGPT replies more accurate than this model. 

After asking ChatGPT, although this model has about 30 times more parameters, there are a lot of reasons why the final result may differ. ex. how it is trained, how it is fine-tuned, what fields it excels on, etc. My guess is that, ChatGPT has been out for a while, so it collected a lot of data as feedback to improve the response, while this one might still lack that amount of data.
